      required to be loaded.
      ii. Add this jar file to the libraries in your project that you created in your IDE.
      iii. Set temporary Classpath by adding the mysql-connector-java-5.0.8-bin.jar in the libraries of your project and this file will be available in your Program files(x86) of        your MySQL folder.
