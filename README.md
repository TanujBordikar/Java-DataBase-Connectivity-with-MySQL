## Java-DataBase-Connectivity-with-MySQL
### Editor : Apache Netbeans IDE 12.5
<ol>
      <li>Let's first create a table in the MySQL database.</li>
      <li>And then create a new Project in Apache Netbeans IDE. for eg: JDBC</li>
      <li>And then connect Java Application with MySQL database</li>
      <h4>Steps!</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>To connect java application with the mysql database, [mysqlconnector.jar](https://static.javatpoint.com/src/jdbc/mysql-connector.jar) file is
      required to be loaded.</li>
      <li>Add this jar file to the libraries in your project that you created in your IDE.</li>
      <li>Set temporary Classpath by adding the mysql-connector-java-5.0.8-bin.jar in the libraries of your project and this file will be available in your Program files(x86) of        your MySQL folder.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>And then make a .java file for connecting with MySQL database. You can refer the above program. And then execute the file.</li>
</ol>
